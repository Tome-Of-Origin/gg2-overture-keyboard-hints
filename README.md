# gg2-overture-keyboard-hints
Keyboard hint mod for GG2: Overture

# Usage
Copy icon_xbox.dds into media/Fonts in the overture folder

# Notes
These binds are only for battle mode, as they are inaccurate in menus unfortunately :( and cant be rebound  
credits to jillscrungus for the tools and info  
some icons may be wrong or less readable than others, i had very tight pixel constraints. B for blast drive and modern cancel will show up as "press WASD" as it uses left stick icon for both move LS and click LS, :( not much i can do sadly until we get access to rebinding
